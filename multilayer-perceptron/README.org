This directory contains work from [[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCH_1BHY58I&list=PLAqhIrjkxbuWI23v9cThsA9GvCAUhRvKZ&index=4][part 3]] of Neural Networks: Zero to Hero by
Andrej Karpathy. This directory goes through rebuilding multilayer perceptron of
[[https://github.com/karpathy/makemore][makemore]].

As we saw in the last section a bigram language model isn't really that good at
generate unique names for us as it only has context for what character *might*
come after the character it has been provided. This effort is to reimplement the
same functionality we did in the bigram data model work, but this time in an
[[https://www.jmlr.org/papers/volume3/bengio03a/bengio03a.pdf][MLP]]. The idea behind a multilayer perceptron can be viewed in the following
diagram:
[[file:images/mlp.png]]

This is image was built with the mind set of the example provided in the MLP
document linked above, wherein the neural network was built with a dataset of
17,000 possible words. In the above image we can see that three indexes are
being passed into the neural network. These indexes are the index of the word in
the dataset (these index would be integers ranging from 0-16,999). In the
diagram they also have a lookup table, ~C~, that is used to lookup the word the
index correlates to.

The included =names.txt= dataset, as an example, has the most common 32,000
names taken from [[https://www.ssa.gov/oact/babynames/][ssa.gov]] for the year 2018. It looks like:
#+begin_example
emma
olivia
ava
isabella
sophia
charlotte
...
#+end_example

We will begin by importing ~PyTorch~ and ~matplotlib~:
#+begin_src jupyter-python :results none
  import torch
  import torch.nn.functional as F
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # for making figures
#+end_src

Then we can begin by opening our =names.txt= file and storing all of the names
in a variable:
#+begin_src jupyter-python :results none
  words = open('names.txt', 'r').read().splitlines()
#+end_src

Now we can build the vocabulary of characters and mappings for converting to and
from integers like we did in the [[../bigram-language-model][bigram]] section of this repository:
#+begin_src jupyter-python :results none
  chars = sorted(list(set(''.join(words))))
  stoi = {s:i+1 for i,s in enumerate(chars)}
  stoi['.'] = 0
  itos = {i:s for s,i in stoi.items()}
