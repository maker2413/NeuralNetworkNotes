#+TITLE: Micrograd

This is simply my reimplementation of [[https://github.com/karpathy/micrograd][micrograd]] and exists only for me to learn
more about neural network technologies. I worked on this while following along
with this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMj-3S1tku0.

If this is also your introduction to Neural Networks like it was mine you should
start with [[./manual-backpropagating.py]] and follow along with the video linked
above.
